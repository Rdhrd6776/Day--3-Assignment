1. Find the data type of a if a=9

int
print(type(a))

2. Find the data type of a if a=9
 
 int
 
3. Find the data type of a if a='9.'

str

4. Find the data type of a if a=(9)

int 

5. Find the data type of a if a=False

bool

6. Find the data type of a if a=[1,2,3]

list

7. Find the data type of a if a=(1,2,3)

tuple

8. Find the data type of a if a={'key': 9}

dictionary

9. Find the data type of a if a=1 + 9j

complex

10. Set a=1 and b=2. What data type is a/b?

float

11. Create a dictionary numbers = {'one':1, 'two':2, 'three':3}. Pull out the number '2' by calling the key 'two'

print(numbers['two'])


12. Create a tuple with the numbers 8, 9, and 10?

tuple=(8,9,10)

13. Run the following lines of code and explain the error in your own words. Then rewrite the lines of code to run error free:
d = {one:1, two:2, three:3} d[one]

#error 
key word must declare in codes if it is a string one ("one","two","three")

#rewrite code 

d={"one":1,"two":2,"three":3}
print(d["one"])

14 .Run the following lines of code and explain the error in your own words. Then rewrite the lines of code to run error free:
f = false not f

False and True are boolean data type . first letter of each word start with capital.

f=False 

15. Run the following lines of code and explain the error in your own words. Then rewrite the lines of code to run error free:
list=[1,2,3]
list[3]


#error 
out of oder because this list contains only 3 elements and if we try to call for the 4th one it can't [3]
any of this can be the used to display the nth elements in list  
 
 list[0]
 list[1]
 list[2]
